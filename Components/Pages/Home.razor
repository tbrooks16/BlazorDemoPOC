<Blog Title="Blazor Demo" TableOfContents="toc">
    <p>This demo is to provide all the knowledge I have acquired from using Blazor. Below you'll find a list of topics.</p>
    <p>
        I go over how to setup the project for Interactive Server and Interactive WebAssembly, 
        a brief demo of how dependency injection works,
        setting up a Form one with WASM and the other with Interactive Server, demonstrating the capabilities of server and client side validation,
        an explanation of how the render modes work in Blazor and their caveats,
        A simple demo of what is possible using the MudBlazor component library,
        and my personal opinion on MudBlazor. 
    </p>
